a lot of the methods described below like deep freezing and naive object comparison will not work correctly for certain data types, such as not only Map, Set, WeakMap and WeakSet, but also function. Hopefully youâ€™re not storing any of these types in your base BehaviorSubject in a service, but if you are, be aware that you will have to manually circumvent any issues relating to these.
